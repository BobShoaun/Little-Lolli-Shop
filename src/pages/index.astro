          Little Lolli was founded in 2013, when I was in high school making
          tiny lil things with a a group of friends 😄

          With the tagline "Little Handcrafted Art with a Big Impact on
          Sustainble Fashion", we are now a sustainability-focused brand that
          pushes for zero-waste, creations with intentions, and slow, ethical
          fashion 🌱
        </p>
        <p class="mt-2">
          Grown and nurtured in Malaysia (much like the artist themselves),
          Little Lolli pays homage to her roots but knows no geographical
          bounds; we ship internationally and might even pop up in your country
          someday! 🌏
        </p>
        <p class="mt-2">
          Thank you for supporting our revival, it means everything for little
          girls who are finally brave enough to pursue their passions 🥹 Thank
          you.”
